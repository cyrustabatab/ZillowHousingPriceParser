# A data entry application that scrapes Zillow for SF rents for 1+ BRs less than 3000 dollars. Submit the result using Selenium on a Google Forms to create spreadsheet of data with address of property, price of property, and Zillow link. Right now, the application only scrapes first page of search results and only works for properties in San Francisco with a rent less than or equal to 3000. A future goal is to create a more generic application that allows the user to specify the city, maximum rents, minimum number of bedrooms or exact number of bedrooms as well as type of property(apartment, condo, etc).
